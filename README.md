## Day 1
### Initial commit
Was used to create githubvs page and it is sorta started since it was a project of mine before
### Testing commits ~18min
Was used to test if vscode could also save to github, it can :)
## Day 2
### Rewriting movement ~3h 15m
I unspagetified my code and started using enum for my player movement to make it more clearer as there still is some of my old code that i will go trogh later :)
but now break time and write devlog
>As well implemented better movement
>walking - simple AD
>dashing - shift (takes 1 stamina)
>jump - space
>walljump - space when on wall (has coyote time) (only 3 times)
>wallslide - sliding on walls makes you fallslower for time
