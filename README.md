# Updates
## Day 1
### Initial commit
Was used to create githubvs page and it is sorta started since it was a project of mine before
### Testing commits ~18min - 18min
Was used to test if vscode could also save to github, it can :)
## Day 2
### [UPDATED ITCH] Rewriting movement ~3h 15m - 3h 33m
I unspagetified my code and started using enum for my player movement to make it more clearer as there still is some of my old code that i will go trogh later :)
but now break time and write devlog
> As well implemented better movement
> - walking - simple AD
> - dashing - shift (takes 1 stamina)
> - jump - space
> - walljump - space when on wall (has coyote time) (only 3 times)
> - wallslide - sliding on walls makes you fallslower for time
### [UPDATED ITCH] Adding more movement ~1s 37m - 5h 10m
More movement :D
> - jumpdash - takes 2 stamina but makes you even more faster
> - groundslam - when in air ctrl and you start to fast fall and can't move, but after landing you can jump again to get to same hights or slide in biger speeds
> - jumpstorage - funny ultrakilltech where if you groundslam the walljump you get full groundslam
> - sliding - ctrl hitbox gets smaller and you slide along in one direction (Litraly still figuring this out with velocity n stuff as thunderstorm is coming so can't work on it D: )
### [UPDATED ITCH] Fixed Slide and weird slides particle effects ~1h 5m -6h  15m
Thats it player has basic movement and now i'm ready to create healt system enemies then guns and some music. Now clocking out of second day after creating this devlog B)
> - sliding - ctrl (fully functional)
> - slide jump - jump when sliding
> - groundslide - after groundslam slide it gives you alot of speed
> - fixed particles - befrore this sometimes they bugged and didn't turn off XD
## Day 3
### Stage ~ 2h - 8h 15m
Added turn order, aswell learned json in order to make enemies esier later.
Aswell more pixelart (i suck at it but ey it's works for now :D)
Player stuck in menue since haven't done fully the switch XD
> - Added some pixel art buttons
> - Made player switch from attack mode to dodge mode and so on
> - Now you can move left and right in diologue and select with w and s
