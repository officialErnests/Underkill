# Updates
## Day 1
### Initial commit
Was used to create githubvs page and it is sorta started since it was a project of mine before
### Testing commits ~18min
Was used to test if vscode could also save to github, it can :)
## Day 2
### [UPDATED ITCH] Rewriting movement ~3h 15m
I unspagetified my code and started using enum for my player movement to make it more clearer as there still is some of my old code that i will go trogh later :)
but now break time and write devlog
> As well implemented better movement
> - walking - simple AD
> - dashing - shift (takes 1 stamina)
> - jump - space
> - walljump - space when on wall (has coyote time) (only 3 times)
> - wallslide - sliding on walls makes you fallslower for time
### Adding more movement ~1s 37m
More movement :D
> - jumpdash - takes 2 stamina but makes you even more faster
> - groundslam - when in air ctrl and you start to fast fall and can't move, but after landing you can jump again to get to same hights or slide in biger speeds
> - jumpstorage - funny ultrakilltech where if you groundslam the walljump you get full groundslam
> - sliding - ctrl hitbox gets smaller and you slide along in one direction (Litraly still figuring this out with velocity n stuff as thunderstorm is coming so can't work on it D: )
